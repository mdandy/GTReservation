##User Interview Results

###Michael Dandy
***Customer:*** CS Undergrad Student

***Problem:*** He wishes that there is a virtual tour guide to campus building.
It will be a huge help for freshmen who oftentimes are overwhelmed with how
big Georgia Tech campus is. Hence, he wants a mobile app that show him basic 
information about the building in Georgia Tech as he walks around campus. This 
information could be: 
* whether or not he has class in that building; if so, show the class schedule
* whether or not the building has study rooms

<hr />

***Customer:*** CS Undergrad Student

***Problem:*** There should be a free PRS system. As we all know, the PRS system
was changed  several semesters ago, and it becomes a huge pain for Seniors. Some 
of their classes require PRS clicker as part of attendance  and/ or participation 
grade. As result, they have to either buy a new PRS clicker or pay for a 
subscription fee. Unlike lower-classmen, Seniors won't use that clicker anymore 
since they are about to graduate.

***Possible fix:*** Create a web or mobile application for PRS system, and it
should be distributed for free.

###Jonathan Edwards
***Customer Archetype:*** Undergraduate, mid-twenties

***Key-pain:*** Parking is a nightmare and he would like to know when one lot is 
open and another isn’t. The lot next to Howey was mentioned, that he will 
drive all the way here just to discover that no spaces are available.

***Possible fixes:*** He didn't mention a solution, just that he would want to 
know when the lots fill up before he gets here. I felt that could be 
accomplished very simply if we could get the data from the parking meter in 
the lot next to Howey, and then just display when the lot is full and when 
it contains vacancies. The same principle could be applied to the lot next 
to the parking registration building in Tech Square.

<hr />

***Customer Archetype:*** Undergraduate, early twenties

***Key-pain:*** I wish there was a way to see if fellow Tech students had the 
textbooks I needed for the semester so I could buy them sooner than I can 
online and save some cash in the process. (The student then described that 
his work-around was to use Reddit.com and find other Georgia Tech students 
who would participate).

***Possible fixes:*** Create an app for textbook trading and sales/requests so 
that Tech Students can benefit from each other’s personal libraries. Limited 
profiles, have the name of the textbook, price, maybe even the class it’s 
for, and location for meetup were suggested as stuff each student could 
enter in a post for the app.

###Kevin Johnstone
***Customer:*** Faculty


***Key-pain:*** Making racquetball reservations using the current pen and paper 
system at the CRC is a hardship. You must phone the CRC and make a blind 
reservation in that you cannot see what reservations are available before 
calling. If there were a mobile or web application that allowed you to make 
reservations online it would be much easier to coordinate reservations with
other players. In adddition, I am not always in a place where I can talk when I want to make a reservation.

<hr />
***Customer:*** Student, undergraduate CS major

***Key-pain:*** Finding groups in classes where you don't know anyone. I have 
taken classes such as ISYE 3770 that have major group projects but I do not 
know anyone in the class. This is a problem for a lot of people and the current 
solution is to just spam the class email with artificial resumes looking for 
groups. It would be cool if there was an app that allowed you to create profiles 
that had your GPA and other credentials and the ability to create groups and add 
members based on other peoples profiles.

<br />
###Josh Zeder
***Customer:*** Undergraduate, early twenties.

***Problem:*** Would like to know how many people are at the gym. He goes to the 
gym and finds it very crowded and has to wait for a long time to use the 
equipment. 

***Possible solutions:*** There are no simple solutions for this problem. You 
can get the number of people coming in because you have to scan buzzcards to get 
in, however there is no way to measure the amount of people leaving.

<hr />
***Customer:*** Undergraduate, teenager.

***Problem:*** He wants to know the fastest walking path to class and how long 
it will take so he knows the latest possible time to leave. This is already 
possible using Google maps, so I do not think it needs to be redone.


##Project Description
Our application will be designed with frequent users of the Campus 
Recreation Center (CRC) in mind. Currently the CRC uses a simple pen and 
paper approach when recording room reservations for activities such as 
racquetball. If students wish to partake in such activities that require 
reserved rooms, then they must travel across campus and check with the front 
desk if there are any vacancies. This can be a real pain since all of the 
rooms could be reserved and you would have no way of knowing until you 
walked all the way across campus to check.

The application will serve to provide a simple, user-friendly interface that 
will list the status of rooms in the CRC as well as offer a way for a user 
to reserve a room remotely (using something as familiar as their GT ID 
Number for validation).

***TODO: Shortcomings of current solutions***

***TODO: Technologies to be used in the solution***

[Pending] Our primary interface will employ HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Our 
backend (since we don’t know yet if there is any database that the CRC uses) 
will consist of PHP and a MySQL database filled with information that would 
be recorded in the event that a database is implemented in the future.
