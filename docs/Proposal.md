Our application will be designed with frequent users of the Campus 
Recreation Center (CRC)  in mind. Currently the CRC uses a simple pen and 
paper approach when recording room reservations for activities such as 
racquetball. If students wish to partake in such activities that require 
reserved rooms, then they must travel across campus and check with the front 
desk if there are any vacancies. This can be a real pain since all of the 
rooms could be reserved and you would have no way of knowing until you 
walked all the way across campus to check.The application will serve to provide a simple, user-friendly interface that 
will list the status of rooms in the CRC as well as offer a way for a user 
to reserve a room remotely (using something as familiar as their GT ID 
Number for validation).


##User Interview Results
via JonathanCustomer Archetype: Undergraduate, mid-twentiesKey-pain: Parking is a nightmare and he would like to know when one lot is 
open and another isn’t. The lot next to Howey was mentioned, that he will 
drive all the way here just to discover that no spaces are available.Possible fixes: He didn’t mention a solution, just that he would want to 
know when the lots fill up before he gets here. I felt that could be 
accomplished very simply if we could get the data from the parking meter in 
the lot next to Howey, and then just display when the lot is full and when 
it contains vacancies. The same principle could be applied to the lot next 
to the parking registration building in Tech Square.Customer Archetype: Undergraduate, early twentiesKey-pain: I wish there was a way to see if fellow Tech students had the 
textbooks I needed for the semester so I could buy them sooner than I can 
online and save some cash in the process. (The student then described that 
his work-around was to use Reddit.com and find other Georgia Tech students 
who would participate).Possible fixes: Create an app for textbook trading and sales/requests so 
that Tech Students can benefit from each other’s personal libraries. Limited 
profiles, have the name of the textbook, price, maybe even the class it’s 
for, and location for meetup were suggested as stuff each student could 
enter in a post for the app.via Kevinvia Michaelvia Josh
##Milestones and Deliverables

***TODO: Present it in table***##References

* Android API - <http://developer.android.com/reference/classes.html>
* PHP Manual - <http://www.php.net/manual/en/> 
* PHP PDO Manual - <http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php>[Pending] Our primary interface will employ HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Our 
backend (since we don’t know yet if there is any database that the CRC uses) 
will consist of PHP and a MySQL database filled with information that would 
be recorded in the event that a database is implemented in the future.
